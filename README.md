## Inspiration
A lack of web3 tools for independent artists to build and monetize their following.

## What it does
Enable artists to earn revenue and gain exposure in new markets through collaboration opportunities.

## How we built it
We modified the smart contracts to fit our needs and connected them to the react front end.

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the smart contracts to our front end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Assembling a team of strangers via The Graph discord chat.

## What we learned
Through a little ingenuity, hard work, and determination a team of strangers can hack together a product that solves a major pain point in the independent music artist ecosystem.

## What's next for PRNTS
Continue to build a more robust PRNTS platform for musicians and implement our 3 collaboration pillars: social bounties (from the Graph hack), project investments (already built) and b.trax (for producers to organize who they've sent beats to).
